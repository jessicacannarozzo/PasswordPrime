<h1>Password Prime</h1>

<p> COMP 3008 Assignment Two</p>
<p> Welcome to our password testing system. Our system generates password based on quotes. </br>
The password consists of the first letter of each word in the quote. We think this will make it easier than remembering random letters.</br>
In this test, you generate three passwords. You can practice each password as many times as you want. </br>
Then, you move on to the testing phase where you have 3 chances to get each password right. Good luck! </p>
